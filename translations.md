## These bits need translations:

- Every game, someone will have the chance to be the Asker. On the first popup as an asker, you can click 'Yes' to randomize a answerer, or 'No' to type a particular person in room. This is similar for almost all other popups, where 'Yes' is for random and 'No' is for typing out yourself. If you are the asker, you can also type '#(number)' to give the question number of the truth/dare in the random list. There are currently... random truths and... random dares, so if you have any feedback feel free to tell me.
